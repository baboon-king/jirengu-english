You can never bring Somebody up if they don't wanna go up

You can't

No matter how good you think you are

No matter how much you want to tell them

You could help them

If they don't wanna go up

There's nothing you can do

But

The reverse is not true

Somebody bad could bring a good person down

They can

Cause the negativity in the world is much more stronger

Than the positive sometimes

The negative people can bring you down

So I stay away from negative people

I just walk away from them
